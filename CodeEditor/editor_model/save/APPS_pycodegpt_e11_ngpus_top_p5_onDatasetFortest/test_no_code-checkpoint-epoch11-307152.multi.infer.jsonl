Right now Danik tells Anton a fairy tale:\n\n\"Once upon a time, there lived an emperor. He was very rich and had much grain. One day he ordered to build a huge barn to put there all his grain. Best builders were building that barn for three days and three nights. But they overlooked and there remained a little hole in the barn, from which every day sparrows came through. Here flew a sparrow, took a grain and flew away...\"\n\nMore formally, the following takes place in the fairy tale. At the beginning of the first day the barn with the capacity of n grains was full. Then, every day (starting with the first day) the following happens:  m grains are brought to the barn. If m grains doesn't fit to the barn, the barn becomes full and the grains that doesn't fit are brought back (in this problem we can assume that the grains that doesn't fit to the barn are not taken into account).  Sparrows come and eat grain. In the i-th day i sparrows come, that is on the first day one sparrow come, on the second day two sparrows come and so on. Every sparrow eats one grain. If the barn is empty, a sparrow eats nothing. \n\nAnton is tired of listening how Danik describes every sparrow that eats grain from the barn. Anton doesn't know when the fairy tale ends, so he asked you to determine, by the end of which day the barn will become empty for the first time. Help Anton and write a program that will determine the number of that day!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^18)\u00a0\u2014 the capacity of the barn and the number of grains that are brought every day.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput one integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of the day when the barn will become empty for the first time.

The following happens:  At the beginning of the first day grain is brought to the barn. It's full, so nothing happens.  At the end of the first day one sparrow comes and eats one grain, so 5 - 1 = 4 grains remain.  At the beginning of the second day two grains are brought. The barn becomes full and one grain doesn't fit to it.  At the end of the second day two sparrows come. 5 - 2 = 3 grains remain.  At the beginning of the third day two grains are brought.

Then, every day (starting with the first day) the following happens:  m grains are brought to the barn.

A bracket sequence is called regular if it it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters \"+\" and \"1\" into this sequence.

So, overall you have $cnt_1$ strings \"((\", $cnt_2$ strings \"()\", $cnt_3$ strings \")(\" and $cnt_4$ strings \"))\". You want to write all these strings in some order, one after another; after that, you will get a long bracket sequence of length $2(cnt_1 + cnt_2 + cnt_3 + cnt_4)$.

As you know, Karen loves palindromes, and she believes that it is good luck to wake up when the time is a palindrome.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of minutes she should sleep, such that, when she wakes up, the time is a palindrome?\n\nRemember that a palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. For instance, 05:39 is not a palindrome, because 05:39 backwards is 93:50. On the other hand, 05:50 is a palindrome, because 05:50 backwards is 05:50.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first and only line of input contains a single string in the format hh:mm (00 \u2264  hh  \u2264 23, 00 \u2264  mm  \u2264 59).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single integer on a line by itself, the minimum number of minutes she should sleep, such that, when she wakes up, the time is a palindrome.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n05:39\n\nOutput\n11\n\nInput\n13:31\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n23:59\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, the minimum number of minutes Karen should sleep for is 11.

She can wake up at 00:00, when the time is a palindrome. \n\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef palindrome_sleep(time):\n    h, m = map(int, time.split(':'))\n    hh = h * 60 + m\n    if hh % 100 == m or hh % 10000 == m:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return 10 - hh % 10\n\nprint(palindrome_sleep(\"05:39\"))\nprint(palindrome_sleep(\"13:31\"))\nprint(palindrome_sleep(\"23:59\"))\n```\n\nThis solution works by first converting the time to minutes and then checking if the last two digits of the time are the same as the last digit of the time. If they are, the time is a palindrome and the function returns 0. Otherwise, the function returns 10 minus the remainder of the time divided by 10. This is because the time is not a palindrome if the last two digits are not the same as the last digit.\nFile \"<string>\", line 21     \tHere is a Python solution for the problem:     \t          ^^^^^^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax", "output": "Karen is getting ready for a new school day!\n\n [Image] \n\nIt is currently hh:mm, given in a 24-hour format.

On the other hand, 05:50 is a palindrome, because 05:50 backwards is 05:50.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first and only line of input contains a single string in the format hh:mm (00 \u2264  hh  \u2264 23, 00 \u2264  mm  \u2264 59).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single integer on a line by itself, the minimum number of minutes she should sleep, such that, when she wakes up, the time is a palindrome.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n05:39\n\nOutput\n11\n\nInput\n13:31\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n23:59\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, the minimum number of minutes Karen should sleep for is 11. She can wake up at 05:50, when the time is a palindrome.\n\nIn the second test case, Karen can wake up immediately, as the current time, 13:31, is already a palindrome.\n\nIn the third test case, the minimum number of minutes Karen should sleep for is 1 minute. She can wake up at 00:00, when the time is a palindrome. \n\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef palindrome_sleep(time):\n    h, m = map(int, time.split(':'))\n    hh = h * 60 + m\n    if hh % 100 == m or hh % 10000 == m:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return 10 - hh % 10\n\nprint(palindrome_sleep(\"05:39\"))\nprint(palindrome_sleep(\"13:31\"))\nprint(palindrome_sleep(\"23:59\"))\n```\n\nThis solution works by first converting the time to minutes and then checking if the last two digits of the time are the same as the last digit of the time. If they are, the time is a palindrome and the function returns 0. Otherwise, the function returns 10 minus the remainder of the time divided by 10. This is because the time is not a palindrome if the last two digits are not the same as the last digit.\nFile \"<string>\", line 21     \tHere is a Python solution for the problem:     \t          ^^^^^^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax", "output": "Karen is getting ready for a new school day!\n\n [Image] \n\nIt is currently hh:mm, given in a 24-hour format.

He has come up with the following tournament format:   In the first several (possibly zero) stages, while the number of teams is even, they split in pairs and play one game for each pair. At each stage the loser of each pair is eliminated (there are no draws). Such stages are held while the number of teams is even.  Eventually there will be an odd number of teams remaining. If there is one team remaining, it will be declared the winner, and the tournament ends. Otherwise each of the remaining teams will play with each other remaining team once in round robin tournament (if there are x teams, there will be $\\frac{x \\cdot(x - 1)}{2}$ games), and the tournament ends. \n\nFor example, if there were 20 teams initially, they would begin by playing 10 games. So, 10 teams would be eliminated, and the remaining 10 would play 5 games. Then the remaining 5 teams would play 10 games in a round robin tournament. In total there would be 10+5+10=25 games.\n\nDaniel has already booked the stadium for n games. Help him to determine how many teams he should invite so that the tournament needs exactly n games.

One pan can have an item of mass 7 and a weight of mass 3, and the second pan can have two weights of masses 9 and 1, correspondingly. Then 7 + 3 = 9 + 1.\n\nNote to the second sample test. One pan of the scales can have an item of mass 99 and the weight of mass 1, and the second pan can have the weight of mass 100.\n\nNote to the third sample test. It is impossible to measure the weight of the item in the manner described in the input.\n\nThis problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. We can start from the maximum weight and try to fit the item into the scales. If we can't fit the item into the scales, we can't fit it into the scales. If we can fit the item into the scales, we can try to fit the remaining part into the scales. If we can't fit the remaining part into the scales either, then it's impossible to fit the item into the scales.\n\nHere is a Python solution:\n\n```python\ndef can_weigh(w, m):\n    weights = [2**i for i in range(11)]\n    weights.append(1)\n    weights.sort(reverse=True)\n    for weight in weights:\n        if weight <= m:\n            m -= weight\n            if m == 0:\n                return 'YES'\n    return 'NO'\n\nw, m = map(int, input().split())\nprint(can_weigh(w, m))\n```\n\nThis solution works by first creating a list of possible weights. Then it sorts this list in descending order. It then tries to fit the item into the scales. If it can't fit the item into the scales, it returns 'NO'. If it can fit the item into the scales, it tries to fit the remaining part into the scales. If it can't fit the remaining part into the scales either, then it returns 'NO'. If it can fit the remaining part into the scales, it returns 'YES'.\nFile \"<string>\", line 21     \tThis problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm.

If the glass is already full, but there is some champagne flowing in it, then it pours over the edge of the glass and is equally distributed over two glasses standing under. If the overflowed glass is at the bottom level, then the champagne pours on the table.\nFile \"<string>\", line 21     \tHere is a Python solution for the problem.     \t          ^^^^^^ SyntaxError: invalid syntaxdef __init__(self, *args):\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       "}, {"id": 57, "input": "After making bad dives into swimming pools, Wilbur wants to build a swimming pool in the shape of a rectangle in his backyard.
