In the third \u2014 5000. 1\n\n\n\n-----Call-Based format-----\n\nCall-Based format is a programming language where you need to implement a function that takes an integer as an input and returns an integer as an output.\n\n\n-----Python-----\n\nHere is a Python solution:\n\n```python\ndef lucky_years(year):\n    def is_lucky(n):\n        return set(str(n)) == {'0', '1'} or str(n) == '2020'\n\n    while not is_lucky(year):\n        year += 1\n\n    return year\n\nprint(lucky_years(int(input())))\n```\n\nIn this solution, we define a helper function `is_lucky` that checks if a number is a lucky number. We then iterate over the years until we find a lucky one.\nFile \"<string>\", line 23     \t-----Call-Based format-----     \t                           ^ IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level", "output": "def is_lucky(n):\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       "}, {"id": 3, "input": "You have a long fence which consists of $n$ sections.

Right now Danik tells Anton a fairy tale:\n\n\"Once upon a time, there lived an emperor. He was very rich and had much grain. One day he ordered to build a huge barn to put there all his grain. Best builders were building that barn for three days and three nights. But they overlooked and there remained a little hole in the barn, from which every day sparrows came through. Here flew a sparrow, took a grain and flew away...\"\n\nMore formally, the following takes place in the fairy tale. At the beginning of the first day the barn with the capacity of n grains was full. Then, every day (starting with the first day) the following happens:  m grains are brought to the barn. If m grains doesn't fit to the barn, the barn becomes full and the grains that doesn't fit are brought back (in this problem we can assume that the grains that doesn't fit to the barn are not taken into account).  Sparrows come and eat grain. In the i-th day i sparrows come, that is on the first day one sparrow come, on the second day two sparrows come and so on. Every sparrow eats one grain. If the barn is empty, a sparrow eats nothing. \n\nAnton is tired of listening how Danik describes every sparrow that eats grain from the barn. Anton doesn't know when the fairy tale ends, so he asked you to determine, by the end of which day the barn will become empty for the first time. Help Anton and write a program that will determine the number of that day!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^18)\u00a0\u2014 the capacity of the barn and the number of grains that are brought every day.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput one integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of the day when the barn will become empty for the first time.

The following happens:  At the beginning of the first day grain is brought to the barn. It's full, so nothing happens.  At the end of the first day one sparrow comes and eats one grain, so 5 - 1 = 4 grains remain.  At the beginning of the second day two grains are brought. The barn becomes full and one grain doesn't fit to it.  At the end of the second day two sparrows come. 5 - 2 = 3 grains remain.  At the beginning of the third day two grains are brought.

At the end of the first day one sparrow comes and eats one grain, so 5 - 1 = 4 grains remain.  At the beginning of the second day two grains are brought. The barn becomes full and one grain doesn't fit to it.  At the end of the second day two sparrows come. 5 - 2 = 3 grains remain.  At the beginning of the third day two grains are brought. The barn becomes full again.  At the end of the third day three sparrows come and eat grain. 5 - 3 = 2 grains remain.  At the beginning of the fourth day grain is brought again. 2 + 2 = 4 grains remain.  At the end of the fourth day four sparrows come and eat grain. 4 - 4 = 0 grains remain. The barn is empty. \n\nSo the answer is 4, because by the end of the fourth day the barn becomes empty. 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "output": "def"}, {"id": 8, "input": "Tokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong.

If the array is sorted, we return the lexicographically maximal permutation.\n\nHere is a Python solution:\n\n```python\ndef solve(n, k, a):\n    a.sort()\n    stack = []\n    for i in range(k):\n        if not stack:\n            stack.append(a.pop())\n        else:\n            while stack and stack[-1] > a[i]:\n                stack.pop()\n            stack.append(a.pop())\n    if stack:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return stack + a\n\nn, k = map(int, input().", "output": "def"}, {"id": 14, "input": "Let's suppose you have an array a, a stack s (initially empty) and an array b (also initially empty).\n\nYou may perform the following operations until both a and s are empty:\n\n  Take the first element of a, push it into s and remove it from a (if a is not empty);  Take the top element from s, append it to the end of array b and remove it from s (if s is not empty). \n\nYou can perform these operations in arbitrary order.\n\nIf there exists a way to perform the operations such that array b is sorted in non-descending order in the end, then array a is called stack-sortable.\n\nFor example, [3, 1, 2] is stack-sortable, because b will be sorted if we perform the following operations:\n\n  Remove 3 from a and push it into s;  Remove 1 from a and push it into s;  Remove 1 from s and append it to the end of b;  Remove 2 from a and push it into s;  Remove 2 from s and append it to the end of b;  Remove 3 from s and append it to the end of b. \n\nAfter all these operations b = [1, 2, 3], so [3, 1, 2] is stack-sortable. [2, 3, 1] is not stack-sortable.\n\nYou are given k first elements of some permutation p of size n (recall that a permutation of size n is an array of size n where each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly once). You have to restore the remaining n - k elements of this permutation so it is stack-sortable. If there are multiple answers, choose the answer such that p is lexicographically maximal (an array q is lexicographically greater than an array p iff there exists some integer k such that for every i < k q_{i} = p_{i}, and q_{k} > p_{k}).

We can start by sorting the given elements in non-descending order. Then we can start popping elements from the sorted array and appending them to the stack.

Now players from all over the world can try his level.\n\nAll levels in this game have two stats to them: the number of plays and the number of clears. So when a player attempts the level, the number of plays increases by $1$. If he manages to finish the level successfully then the number of clears increases by $1$ as well. Note that both of the statistics update at the same time (so if the player finishes the level successfully then the number of plays will increase at the same time as the number of clears).\n\nPolycarp is very excited about his level, so he keeps peeking at the stats to know how hard his level turns out to be.\n\nSo he peeked at the stats $n$ times and wrote down $n$ pairs of integers \u2014 $(p_1, c_1), (p_2, c_2), \\dots, (p_n, c_n)$, where $p_i$ is the number of plays at the $i$-th moment of time and $c_i$ is the number of clears at the same moment of time. The stats are given in chronological order (i.e. the order of given pairs is exactly the same as Polycarp has written down).\n\nBetween two consecutive moments of time Polycarp peeked at the stats many players (but possibly zero) could attempt the level.\n\nFinally, Polycarp wonders if he hasn't messed up any records and all the pairs are correct.

On the other hand, 05:50 is a palindrome, because 05:50 backwards is 05:50.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first and only line of input contains a single string in the format hh:mm (00 \u2264  hh  \u2264 23, 00 \u2264  mm  \u2264 59).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single integer on a line by itself, the minimum number of minutes she should sleep, such that, when she wakes up, the time is a palindrome.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n05:39\n\nOutput\n11\n\nInput\n13:31\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n23:59\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, the minimum number of minutes Karen should sleep for is 11. She can wake up at 05:50, when the time is a palindrome.\n\nIn the second test case, Karen can wake up immediately, as the current time, 13:31, is already a palindrome.\n\nIn the third test case, the minimum number of minutes Karen should sleep for is 1 minute. She can wake up at 00:00, when the time is a palindrome. \n\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef palindrome_sleep(time):\n    h, m = map(int, time.split(':'))\n    hh = h * 60 + m\n    if hh % 100 == m or hh % 10000 == m:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return 10 - hh % 10\n\nprint(palindrome_sleep(\"05:39\"))\nprint(palindrome_sleep(\"13:31\"))\nprint(palindrome_sleep(\"23:59\"))\n```\n\nThis solution works by first converting the time to minutes and then checking if the last two digits of the time are the same as the last digit of the time. If they are, the time is a palindrome and the function returns 0. Otherwise, the function returns 10 minus the remainder of the time divided by 10. This is because the time is not a palindrome if the last two digits are not the same as the last digit.\nFile \"<string>\", line 21     \tHere is a Python solution for the problem:     \t          ^^^^^^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax", "output": "def palindrome_sleep(time):\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "}, {"id": 20, "input": "Karen is getting ready for a new school day!\n\n [Image] \n\nIt is currently hh:mm, given in a 24-hour format.

The distance between two elements is considered to be equal to the absolute difference between their positions.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100)\u00a0\u2014 the size of the permutation.\n\nThe second line of the input contains n distinct integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 n), where a_{i} is equal to the element at the i-th position.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the maximum possible distance between the minimum and the maximum elements Nicholas can achieve by performing exactly one swap.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n4 5 1 3 2\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n7\n1 6 5 3 4 7 2\n\nOutput\n6\n\nInput\n6\n6 5 4 3 2 1\n\nOutput\n5\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, one may obtain the optimal answer by swapping elements 1 and 2.\n\nIn the second sample, the minimum and the maximum elements will be located in the opposite ends of the array if we swap 7 and 2.\n\nIn the third sample, the distance between the minimum and the maximum elements is already maximum possible, so we just perform some unnecessary swap, for example, one can swap 5 and 2.\n\nThis problem can be solved using a greedy approach. We can start by finding the minimum and maximum elements in the array. We can then swap the maximum element with the minimum element if they are not in the same position.\n\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef min_max_distance(n, a):\n    min_element = min(a)\n    max_element = max(a)\n    if min_element!= max_element:\n        return n - a.index(max_element) - a[::-1].index(min_element)\n    else:\n        return n - a.index(max_element)\n\nn = int(input().strip())\na = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))\nprint(min_max_distance(n, a))\n```\n\nIn this solution, we first find the minimum and maximum elements in the array. If they are not the same, we calculate the distance between the maximum and minimum elements and subtract it from the total size of the array. If they are the same, we just return the total size of the array minus one, because we can perform one swap to make the maximum element equal to the minimum element.\nFile \"<string>\", line 21     \tThis problem can be solved using a greedy approach.

Then it initializes the array `d` with zeros. For each element in `a`, if it's zero, it calculates the distance to the nearest zero element in `a`. If there is no zero element before the current element, it calculates the distance to the nearest zero element in `a`. If there is a zero element before the current element, it calculates the distance to the nearest zero element in `a` to the left of the current element. The distances are stored in `d`. Finally, it prints the distances separated by spaces.\nFile \"<string>\", line 37     \tThis code first reads the number of elements `n` and the array `a`.

He has come up with the following tournament format:   In the first several (possibly zero) stages, while the number of teams is even, they split in pairs and play one game for each pair. At each stage the loser of each pair is eliminated (there are no draws). Such stages are held while the number of teams is even.  Eventually there will be an odd number of teams remaining. If there is one team remaining, it will be declared the winner, and the tournament ends. Otherwise each of the remaining teams will play with each other remaining team once in round robin tournament (if there are x teams, there will be $\\frac{x \\cdot(x - 1)}{2}$ games), and the tournament ends. \n\nFor example, if there were 20 teams initially, they would begin by playing 10 games. So, 10 teams would be eliminated, and the remaining 10 would play 5 games. Then the remaining 5 teams would play 10 games in a round robin tournament. In total there would be 10+5+10=25 games.\n\nDaniel has already booked the stadium for n games. Help him to determine how many teams he should invite so that the tournament needs exactly n games.

He has come up with the following tournament format:   In the first several (possibly zero) stages, while the number of teams is even, they split in pairs and play one game for each pair. At each stage the loser of each pair is eliminated (there are no draws). Such stages are held while the number of teams is even.  Eventually there will be an odd number of teams remaining. If there is one team remaining, it will be declared the winner, and the tournament ends. Otherwise each of the remaining teams will play with each other remaining team once in round robin tournament (if there are x teams, there will be $\\frac{x \\cdot(x - 1)}{2}$ games), and the tournament ends. \n\nFor example, if there were 20 teams initially, they would begin by playing 10 games. So, 10 teams would be eliminated, and the remaining 10 would play 5 games. Then the remaining 5 teams would play 10 games in a round robin tournament. In total there would be 10+5+10=25 games.\n\nDaniel has already booked the stadium for n games. Help him to determine how many teams he should invite so that the tournament needs exactly n games.

We can start from the maximum weight and try to fit the item into the scales. If we can't fit the item into the scales, we can't fit it into the scales. If we can fit the item into the scales, we can try to fit the remaining part into the scales. If we can't fit the remaining part into the scales either, then it's impossible to fit the item into the scales.\n\nHere is a Python solution:\n\n```python\ndef can_weigh(w, m):\n    weights = [2**i for i in range(11)]\n    weights.append(1)\n    weights.sort(reverse=True)\n    for weight in weights:\n        if weight <= m:\n            m -= weight\n            if m == 0:\n                return 'YES'\n    return 'NO'\n\nw, m = map(int, input().split())\nprint(can_weigh(w, m))\n```\n\nThis solution works by first creating a list of possible weights. Then it sorts this list in descending order. It then tries to fit the item into the scales. If it can't fit the item into the scales, it returns 'NO'. If it can fit the item into the scales, it tries to fit the remaining part into the scales. If it can't fit the remaining part into the scales either, then it returns 'NO'. If it can fit the remaining part into the scales, it returns 'YES'.\nFile \"<string>\", line 21     \tThis problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm.

Students like to dream of a beautiful life, so they used champagne glasses to construct a small pyramid. The height of the pyramid is n. The top level consists of only 1 glass, that stands on 2 glasses on the second level (counting from the top), then 3 glasses on the third level and so on.The bottom level consists of n glasses.\n\nVlad has seen in the movies many times how the champagne beautifully flows from top levels to bottom ones, filling all the glasses simultaneously. So he took a bottle and started to pour it in the glass located at the top of the pyramid.\n\nEach second, Vlad pours to the top glass the amount of champagne equal to the size of exactly one glass. If the glass is already full, but there is some champagne flowing in it, then it pours over the edge of the glass and is equally distributed over two glasses standing under. If the overflowed glass is at the bottom level, then the champagne pours on the table. For the purpose of this problem we consider that champagne is distributed among pyramid glasses immediately. Vlad is interested in the number of completely full glasses if he stops pouring champagne in t seconds.\n\nPictures below illustrate the pyramid consisting of three levels. [Image] [Image] \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains two integers n and t (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10, 0 \u2264 t \u2264 10 000)\u00a0\u2014 the height of the pyramid and the number of seconds Vlad will be pouring champagne from the bottle.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the single integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of completely full glasses after t seconds.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 5\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n4 8\n\nOutput\n6\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, the glasses full after 5 seconds are: the top glass, both glasses on the second level and the middle glass at the bottom level. Left and right glasses of the bottom level will be half-empty.\n\nHere is a Python solution for the problem.\n\n```python\ndef glasses(n, t):\n    full_glasses = 0\n    glasses_on_top = n\n    for _ in range(t):\n        glasses_on_top = glasses_on_top // 2\n        full_glasses += glasses_on_top\n    return full_glasses\n\nprint(glasses(3, 5))  # Output: 4\nprint(glasses(4, 8))  # Output: 6\n```\n\nThis solution works by iterating over the number of seconds Vlad will be pouring champagne from the bottle. For each second, it calculates the number of glasses on the top level and adds it to the total number of full glasses. The calculation of the number of glasses on the top level is done by integer division (//) of the number of glasses on the top level by 2.

This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. \n\nIf there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$. Changing an operation means replacing it with some operation (possibly the same); Vasya can't insert new operations into the sequence or remove them.\n\nHelp Vasya!

This is because you can remove the remaining length divided by k number of digits.\nFile \"<string>\", line 21     \tHere is a Python solution:     \t          ^^^^^^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax", "output": "def min_digits(n, k):\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 "}, {"id": 71, "input": "On the Literature lesson Sergei noticed an awful injustice, it seems that some students are asked more often than others.\n\nSeating in the class looks like a rectangle, where n rows with m pupils in each. \n\nThe teacher asks pupils in the following order: at first, she asks all pupils from the first row in the order of their seating, then she continues to ask pupils from the next row.

Finally, it prints the number of primes and the primes themselves.\nFile \"<string>\", line 21     \tThis problem can be solved by using a combination of dynamic programming and prime number theory.     \t     ^^^^^^^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax", "output": "def __init__(self, input):\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                            "}, {"id": 75, "input": "You are given a description of a depot.

Now some of the pixels are \"dead\", that is, they are always black. As consequence, Innocentius can't play the usual computer games. He is recently playing the following game with his younger brother Polycarpus.\n\nInnocentius is touch-typing a program that paints a white square one-pixel wide frame on the black screen. As the monitor is broken, some pixels that should be white remain black. Polycarpus should look at what the program displayed on the screen and guess the position and size of the frame Innocentius has painted. Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as \"the game is good for the imagination and attention\".\n\nHelp Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that:  the frame's width is 1 pixel,  the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen,  all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame,  of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. \n\nFormally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 2000).

Character \".\" (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character \"w\" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters \"+\" (the \"plus\" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as \"w\".

If it's not possible, it prints \"NO\".\nFile \"<string>\", line 43     \tThis solution works by first checking if it's possible to buy some amount of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars to spend exactly n burles.

We can start with the smallest divisor as 1 and keep increasing it until we find the k-th smallest divisor.\n\nHere is a Python solution:\n\n```python\ndef find_kth_smallest_divisor(n, k):\n    left, right = 1, n\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if mid * mid > n:\n            right = mid\n        else:\n            left = mid + 1\n    return left if left * left <= n else -1\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\nprint(find_kth_smallest_divisor(n, k))\n```\n\nThis solution works by using a binary search to find the k-th smallest divisor. The binary search is performed by updating the right pointer to mid and the left pointer to mid + 1 if mid * mid > n. If mid * mid <= n, then the k-th smallest divisor must be on the right side, so we update the left pointer to mid + 1. The binary search continues until the left pointer is equal to the right pointer. If the left pointer is still greater than the square of n, then the k-th smallest divisor doesn't exist, so we return -1. Otherwise, we return the left pointer as the k-th smallest divisor.\nFile \"<string>\", line 40     \tThis solution works by using a binary search to find the k-th smallest divisor.

Each road can be represented as two parts where each part has 3 lanes getting into the intersection (one for each direction) and 3 lanes getting out of the intersection, so we have 4 parts in total. Each part has 4 lights, one for each lane getting into the intersection (l \u2014 left, s \u2014 straight, r \u2014 right) and a light p for a pedestrian crossing.  [Image] \n\nAn accident is possible if a car can hit a pedestrian. This can happen if the light of a pedestrian crossing of some part and the light of a lane that can get to or from that same part are green at the same time.\n\nNow, Sagheer is monitoring the configuration of the traffic lights. Your task is to help him detect whether an accident is possible.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of four lines with each line describing a road part given in a counter-clockwise order.\n\nEach line contains four integers l, s, r, p \u2014 for the left, straight, right and pedestrian lights, respectively. The possible values are 0 for red light and 1 for green light.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOn a single line, print \"YES\" if an accident is possible, and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 1\n\nOutput\nNO\n\nInput\n1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, some accidents are possible because cars of part 1 can hit pedestrians of parts 1 and 4. Also, cars of parts 2 and 3 can hit pedestrians of part 4.\n\nIn the second example, no car can pass the pedestrian crossing of part 4 which is the only green pedestrian light. So, no accident can occur.\n\nThis problem can be solved by using a combination of the concept of bitwise operations and the concept of the state of the traffic lights.\n\nThe idea is to represent the state of the traffic lights as a bitmask. Each bit in the bitmask represents a light. The first bit represents the left light, the second bit represents the straight light, the third bit represents the right light, and the fourth bit represents the pedestrian light.\n\nThe state of the traffic lights can be represented as follows:\n\n- 0000: No cars\n- 0001: One car going left\n- 0010: One car going straight\n- 0100: One car going right\n- 1000: One car going left and one car going straight\n- 1111: All cars going left, straight, right and pedestrian\n\nWe can then use bitwise operations to determine the state of the traffic lights. For example, to check if an accident is possible, we can check if the state of the traffic lights is one of the following:\n\n- 0001 or 0010 or 0100 or 1000\n- 0001 or 0010 or 0100 or 1111\n- 0001 or 0001 or 0100 or 1000\n- 0001 or 0010 or 0010 or 1000\n- 0001 or 0001 or 0010 or 1111\n\nIf the state of the traffic lights is one of these, then an accident is possible. Otherwise, no accident is possible.\n\nHere is a Python code snippet that implements this idea:\n\n```python\ndef check_accident_possible():\n    state = 0\n    for line in range(4):\n        l, s, r, p = map(int, input().split())\n        state |= l << (2 * line)\n        state |= s << (2 * line + 1)\n        state |= r << (2 * line + 2)\n        state |= p << (2 * line + 3)\n    if state in (1 << 0 | 1 << 2 | 1 << 4 | 1 << 6, 1 << 1 | 1 << 3 | 1 << 5 | 1 << 7, 1 << 1 | 1 << 2 | 1 << 4 | 1 << 6, 1 << 1 | 1 << 3 | 1 << 4 | 1 << 7):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\ncheck_accident_possible()\n```\n\nThis code reads the state of the traffic lights from", "output": "def"}, {"id": 125, "input": "Sagheer is walking in the street when he comes to an intersection of two roads.

This is done by finding the maximum messiness that can be achieved by swapping the cow with the cow that is k positions away from the current cow.\n\nHere is the Python code for the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom bisect import bisect_right\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\np = list(map(int, input().split()))\np.sort()\nprefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + (i + 1) - p[i]\nanswer = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    j = bisect_right(p, p[i] + k)\n    answer = max(answer, prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[i + 1] - (n - i - 1) + j)\nprint(answer)\n```\n\nThis code first sorts the cows by their labels, then calculates the prefix sum of the messiness of the arrangement of cows. Finally, it iterates over the cows, and for each cow, finds the maximum messiness that can be achieved by swapping it with another cow. This is done by finding the maximum messiness that can be achieved by swapping the cow with the cow that is k positions away from the current cow.\nFile \"<string>\", line 21     \tThis problem can be solved using a combination of sorting and prefix sum.     \t     ^^^^^^^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax", "output": "def __init__(self, *a, *b):\n                                                                                                                                                           "}, {"id": 129, "input": "Ivan is collecting coins.

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nSo, if we have a right-angled triangle with side length 'n', we can find the Pythagorean triple by iterating through all possible values of'm' and 'k' such that'm' and 'k' are positive integers and'm' and 'k' are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). Then, we check if'm' and 'k' are both less than or equal to 'n' and if the sum of'm' and 'k' is equal to 'n'. If we find such a triple, we return it. If we don't find any such triple, we return -1.\n\nHere is a Python code snippet that implements this algorithm:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_pythagorean_triple(n):\n    for m in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        for k in range(1, m):\n            if math.gcd(m, k) == 1 and m * m + k * k == n * n:\n                return m, k\n    return -1\n\nn = int(input())\nm, k = find_pythagorean_triple(n)\nif m!= -1:\n    print(m, k)\nelse:\n    print(-1)\n```\n\nThis code first calculates the square root of 'n' and iterates from 2 to the square root of 'n'.

Formally, a word is typed with a typo if there is a block of not less that three consonants in a row, and there are at least two different letters in this block.\n\nFor example:\n\n  the following words have typos: \"hellno\", \"hackcerrs\" and \"backtothefutttture\";  the following words don't have typos: \"helllllooooo\", \"tobeornottobe\" and \"oooooo\". \n\nWhen Beroffice editor finds a word with a typo, it inserts as little as possible number of spaces in this word (dividing it into several words) in such a way that each of the resulting words is typed without any typos.\n\nImplement this feature of Beroffice editor.

We can start by checking if the word has any vowels. If it does, we can replace the vowels with a space and return the word.

Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of n rows and m columns. Cell (x, y) is the cell in the x-th row in the y-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.\n\nMoreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1, 1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (n, 1) \u2014 the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion \u2014 all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up.

Let's introduce a two-dimensional coordinate system so that point (0, 0) lies in the lower left corner of the field, if you look at the box above. Robo-Wallace is playing for the team, whose goal is to the right. It is an improvised football field, so the gate of Robo-Wallace's rivals may be not in the middle of the left wall. [Image] \n\nIn the given coordinate system you are given:   y_1, y_2 \u2014 the y-coordinates of the side pillars of the goalposts of robo-Wallace's opponents;  y_{w} \u2014 the y-coordinate of the wall to which Robo-Wallace is aiming;  x_{b}, y_{b} \u2014 the coordinates of the ball's position when it is hit;  r \u2014 the radius of the ball. \n\nA goal is scored when the center of the ball crosses the OY axis in the given coordinate system between (0, y_1) and (0, y_2). The ball moves along a straight line. The ball's hit on the wall is perfectly elastic (the ball does not shrink from the hit), the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. If the ball bounces off the wall not to the goal, that is, if it hits the other wall or the goal post, then the opposing team catches the ball and Robo-Wallace starts looking for miscalculation and gets dysfunctional. Such an outcome, if possible, should be avoided. We assume that the ball touches an object, if the distance from the center of the ball to the object is no greater than the ball radius r.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first and the single line contains integers y_1, y_2, y_{w}, x_{b}, y_{b}, r (1 \u2264 y_1, y_2, y_{w}, x_{b}, y_{b} \u2264 10^6; y_1 < y_2 < y_{w}; y_{b} + r < y_{w}; 2\u00b7r < y_2 - y_1).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the ball is positioned correctly in the field, doesn't cross any wall, doesn't touch the wall that Robo-Wallace is aiming at. The goal posts can't be located in the field corners.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf Robo-Wallace can't score a goal in the described manner, print \"-1\" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print a single number x_{w} \u2014 the abscissa of his point of aiming. \n\nIf there are multiple points of aiming, print the abscissa of any of them. When checking the correctness of the answer, all comparisons are made with the permissible absolute error, equal to 10^{ - 8}. \n\nIt is recommended to print as many characters after the decimal point as possible.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 10 13 10 3 1\n\nOutput\n4.3750000000\n\nInput\n1 4 6 2 2 1\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n3 10 15 17 9 2\n\nOutput\n11.3333", "output": "def"}, {"id": 165, "input": "Vasiliy spent his vacation in a sanatorium, came back and found that he completely forgot details of his vacation! \n\nEvery day there was a breakfast, a dinner and a supper in a dining room of the sanatorium (of course, in this order).

It can be proved, that it is impossible to have less number of stones after making the operations.\n\nIn the fourth test, if Vasya had $0$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $3$. 3\n\nIn the fifth test, if Vasya had $2$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $3$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "output": "def"}, {"id": 169, "input": "Kolya Gerasimov loves kefir very much.

The main difference is that the expression is a logical expression and not a simple arithmetic expression. The problem is to determine if it is possible to place brackets in the expression so that its value is false. If it is possible, print the expression with the required brackets. Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThe logic behind this problem is to use the concept of logical implication and the property of implication that if the first argument is true and the second argument is false, then the implication is false. We can use this property to determine if it is possible to place brackets in the expression so that its value is false.\n\nIn Python, we can solve this problem by using recursion and backtracking.

Finally, we return the result.\nFile \"<string>\", line 22     \t-----Hint-----     \t              ^ IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level", "output": "def __init__(self, *args):\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      "}, {"id": 177, "input": "Let's write all the positive integer numbers one after another from $1$ without any delimiters (i.e. as a single string).

It first checks if the first digit of the string is 8. If it is not, it returns 'NO'. If it is, it then checks if the first 11 characters of the string are all 8. If they are, it returns 'YES'.

Vasya's team creates software and hardware for identification of people by their face.\n\nOne of the project's know-how is a camera rotating around its optical axis on shooting. People see an eye-catching gadget \u2014 a rotating camera \u2014 come up to it to see it better, look into it. And the camera takes their photo at that time. What could be better for high quality identification?\n\nBut not everything is so simple. The pictures from camera appear rotated too (on clockwise camera rotation frame the content becomes rotated counter-clockwise). But the identification algorithm can work only with faces that are just slightly deviated from vertical.\n\nVasya was entrusted to correct the situation \u2014 to rotate a captured image so that image would be minimally deviated from vertical. Requirements were severe. Firstly, the picture should be rotated only on angle divisible by 90 degrees to not lose a bit of information about the image. Secondly, the frames from the camera are so huge and FPS is so big that adequate rotation speed is provided by hardware FPGA solution only. And this solution can rotate only by 90 degrees clockwise. Of course, one can apply 90 degrees turn several times but for the sake of performance the number of turns should be minimized.\n\nHelp Vasya implement the program that by the given rotation angle of the camera can determine the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which up direction deviation from vertical is minimum.\n\nThe next figure contains frames taken from an unrotated camera, then from rotated 90 degrees clockwise, then from rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Arrows show direction to \"true up\". [Image] \n\nThe next figure shows 90 degrees clockwise turn by FPGA hardware. [Image] \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains one integer x ( - 10^18 \u2264 x \u2264 10^18) \u2014 camera angle in degrees. Positive value denotes clockwise camera rotation, negative \u2014 counter-clockwise.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput one integer \u2014 the minimum required number of 90 degrees clockwise turns.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n60\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n-60\n\nOutput\n3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nWhen the camera is rotated 60 degrees counter-clockwise (the second example), an image from it is rotated 60 degrees clockwise.

Passing levels one by one, Nastya eventually faced a problem.

There is exactly one coin under every manhole, and to win the game Nastya should pick all the coins. Initially Nastya stands near the $k$-th manhole from the left. She is thinking what to do.\n\nIn one turn, Nastya can do one of the following:   if there is at least one stone on the manhole Nastya stands near, throw exactly one stone from it onto any other manhole (yes, Nastya is strong).  go to a neighboring manhole;  if there are no stones on the manhole Nastya stays near, she can open it and pick the coin from it. After it she must close the manhole immediately (it doesn't require additional moves). \n\n [Image] The figure shows the intermediate state of the game. At the current position Nastya can throw the stone to any other manhole or move left or right to the neighboring manholes. If she were near the leftmost manhole, she could open it (since there are no stones on it). \n\nNastya can leave the room when she picks all the coins.

Otherwise, the game is possible to make fair.\n\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    a = sorted([int(x) for x in input().strip().split()], reverse=True)\n    if a[0] == a[-1]:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        print(a[0], a[-1])\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n\nThis solution works by first reading the number of cards and the numbers on the cards. It then sorts the numbers in descending order. If the first and last numbers are the same, it prints \"YES\" and the numbers that Petya and Vasya should choose. Otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\nFile \"<string>\", line 21     \tThe problem can be solved by using a greedy approach. First, sort the numbers on the cards in descending order.

Exactly $k$ times the following happens:   Two numbers $i$ and $j$ are chosen equiprobable such that ($1 \\leq i < j \\leq n$).  The numbers in the $i$ and $j$ positions are swapped. \n\nSonya's task is to find the probability that after all the operations are completed, the $a$ array will be sorted in non-decreasing order.

For example, the number $9200$ has two trailing zeros. Aki thinks the more trailing zero digits a number has, the prettier it is.\n\nHowever, Aki believes, that the number of trailing zeros of a number is not static, but depends on the base (radix) it is represented in. Thus, he considers a few scenarios with some numbers and bases.

If after an answer the counter reaches the number k, then it is reset, and the player's score is doubled. Note that in this case, first 1 point is added to the player's score, and then the total score is doubled.

The minimum possible score is obtained when the only wrong answer is to the question 4.\n\nAlso note that you are asked to minimize the score and not the remainder of the score modulo 1000000009.

Manao answered 3 questions out of 5, and his score would double for each two consecutive correct answers. If Manao had answered the first, third and fifth questions, he would have scored as much as 3 points.\n\nSample 2. Now Manao answered 4 questions. The minimum possible score is obtained when the only wrong answer is to the question 4.\n\nAlso note that you are asked to minimize the score and not the remainder of the score modulo 1000000009. For example, if Manao could obtain either 2000000000 or 2000000020 points, the answer is 2000000000\u00a0mod\u00a01000000009, even though 2000000020\u00a0mod\u00a01000000009 is a smaller number.\n\nThis problem can be solved by using dynamic programming.

It means that there exists a building with equal number of flats on each floor so that the flats from Polycarp's memory have the floors Polycarp remembers.\n\nGiven this information, is it possible to restore the exact floor for flat n? \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 0 \u2264 m \u2264 100), where n is the number of the flat you need to restore floor for, and m is the number of flats in Polycarp's memory.\n\nm lines follow, describing the Polycarp's memory: each of these lines contains a pair of integers k_{i}, f_{i} (1 \u2264 k_{i} \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 f_{i} \u2264 100), which means that the flat k_{i} is on the f_{i}-th floor. All values k_{i} are distinct.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given information is not self-contradictory.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the number of the floor in which the n-th flat is located, if it is possible to determine it in a unique way. Print -1 if it is not possible to uniquely restore this floor.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n10 3\n6 2\n2 1\n7 3\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n8 4\n3 1\n6 2\n5 2\n2 1\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example the 6-th flat is on the 2-nd floor, while the 7-th flat is on the 3-rd, so, the 6-th flat is the last on its floor and there are 3 flats on each floor. Thus, the 10-th flat is on the 4-th floor.\n\nIn the second example there can be 3 or 4 flats on each floor, so we can't restore the floor for the 8-th flat.\n\nHere is a Python solution using call-based format.\n\n```python\ndef restore_floor(n, m, memory):\n    flats = [0] * (n + 1)\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    for k, f in memory:\n        if not visited[f]:\n            flats[f] = k\n            visited[f] = True\n        else:\n            return -1\n    return flats[n]\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, input().split())\n    memory = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]\n    print(restore_floor(n, m, memory))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program first initializes an array `flats` to store the flat numbers and an array `visited` to keep track of which floors have been visited. Then it iterates over the memory list, updating the `flats` array and the `visited` array as necessary. If it encounters a flat that has already been visited, it returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the flat number for the n-th flat.\nFile \"<string>\", line 21     \tHere is a Python solution using call-based format.     \t          ^^^^^^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax", "output": "def __init__(self, input):\n                                                                        "}, {"id": 214, "input": "Bishwock is a chess figure that consists of three squares resembling an \"L-bar\".

After that $8314$ become equals to $81$, which is the square of the integer $9$.\n\nIn the second example the given $625$ is the square of the integer $25$, so you should not delete anything. \n\nIn the third example it is impossible to make the square from $333$, so the answer is -1.\n\nHere is a Python solution using a call-based approach.\n\n```python\ndef min_operations(n):\n    n = str(n)\n    length = len(n)\n    if length == 1:\n        return -1\n    elif length == 2:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        left, right = 0, 9\n        for i in range(length - 2):\n            left = int(n[i])\n            right = int(n[i + 2])\n            if left!= right:\n                return i + 1\n        return -1\n\n\nprint(min_operations(8314))  # Output: 2\nprint(min_operations(625))  # Output: 0\nprint(min_operations(333))  # Output: -1\n```\n\nThis solution works by iterating over the digits of the number and comparing the current digit with the next digit. If they are not the same, it means that we need to delete the current digit. The number of operations is the index of the current digit plus one. If the number of digits is less than or equal to 2, it means that the number is already a square, so it returns -1.\nFile \"<string>\", line 21     \tHere is a Python solution using a call-based approach.     \t          ^^^^^^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax", "output": "def min_operations(n):\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 "}, {"id": 223, "input": "Let's define a function $f(p)$ on a permutation $p$ as follows.

If the number of knights with each color falls outside the given counts, we slide the window to the right until the number of knights with each color is within the given counts.\n\nHere is a Python solution:\n\n```python\ndef can_reach_colors():\n    n, m = map(int, input().split())\n    colors = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    counts = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n    window_start = 0\n    window_end = 0\n    current_counts = [0]*m\n\n    while window_end < n:\n        current_counts[colors[window_end]-1] += 1\n\n        while all(current_count <= count for current_count, count in zip(current_counts, counts)):\n            if window_end - window_start + 1 == sum(counts):\n                return \"YES\"\n\n            current_counts[colors[window_start]-1] -= 1\n            window_start += 1\n\n        window_end += 1\n\n    return \"NO\"\n\nprint(can_reach_colors())\n```\n\nThis solution works by maintaining a window of knights with each color in the current window. It then slides the window to the right until the number of knights with each color is within the given counts. If the window size is equal to the sum of the desired counts, it returns \"YES\".

Please help her!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains single integer n n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100)\u00a0\u2014 the number of game rounds.\n\nThe next n lines contains rounds description. i-th of them contains pair of integers m_{i} and c_{i} (1 \u2264 m_{i},  c_{i} \u2264 6)\u00a0\u2014 values on dice upper face after Mishka's and Chris' throws in i-th round respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf Mishka is the winner of the game, print \"Mishka\" (without quotes) in the only line.\n\nIf Chris is the winner of the game, print \"Chris\" (without quotes) in the only line.\n\nIf the result of the game is draw, print \"Friendship is magic!^^\" (without quotes) in the only line.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n3 5\n2 1\n4 2\n\nOutput\nMishka\nInput\n2\n6 1\n1 6\n\nOutput\nFriendship is magic!^^\nInput\n3\n1 5\n3 3\n2 2\n\nOutput\nChris\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample case Mishka loses the first round, but wins second and third rounds and thus she is the winner of the game.\n\nIn the second sample case Mishka wins the first round, Chris wins the second round, and the game ends with draw with score 1:1.\n\nIn the third sample case Chris wins the first round, but there is no winner of the next two rounds. The winner of the game is Chris.\n\nThis problem can be solved by using a simple loop to simulate each round and keep track of the scores. If Mishka's score is higher than Chris's, she wins the round. If Chris's score is higher, he wins the round. If both scores are equal, it's a draw.\n\nHere is a Python solution:\n\n```python\nn = int(input().strip())\nm_score = 0\nc_score = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    m, c = map(int, input().strip().split())\n    if m > c:\n        m_score += 1\n    elif c > m:\n        c_score += 1\n    else:\n        m_score += 0.5\n        c_score += 0.5\n\nif m_score > c_score:\n    print(\"Mishka\")\nelif c_score > m_score:\n    print(\"Chris\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Friendship is magic!^^\")\n```\n\nThis solution works by iterating over each round, and incrementing the appropriate score based on the outcome of the round. It then compares the scores to determine the winner of the game.\nFile \"<string>\", line 21     \tThis problem can be solved by using a simple loop to simulate each round and keep track of the scores.

The number of digits in this string does not exceed 1 000 000.\n\nThe second line contains the substring of n which Vasya remembers. This string can contain leading zeroes. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the input data is correct, and the answer always exists.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the smalles integer n which Vasya could pass to Kate.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n003512\n021\n\nOutput\n30021\n\nInput\n199966633300\n63\n\nOutput\n3036366999 3036366999\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, the string \"003512\" is passed to Kate. The substring of n that Vasya remembers is \"021\". The smallest possible initial integer n is 30021.\n\nIn the second example, the string \"199966633300\" is passed to Kate. The substring of n that Vasya remembers is \"63\". The smallest possible initial integer n is 3036366999.\n\n\n-----Hint-----\n\nThis problem is a variant of the classic \"find the smallest number that can be formed from a given set of digits\" problem. The key is to understand that the smallest possible number is the one that can be formed by using the digits in the given set in any order.\nFile \"<string>\", line 22     \t-----Note-----     \t              ^ IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level", "output": "def __init__(self, input):\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               "}, {"id": 240, "input": "Vasya decided to pass a very large integer n to Kate.
